# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is a **blueprint** or **skeletal framework** of a website or application. It defines the basic structure and layout of a product without focusing on detailed visual elements like colors, fonts, or images. Instead, wireframes emphasize **functionality, navigation, and user experience**.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Ideas**: Translates abstract concepts into clear, tangible layouts.
- **Facilitates Communication**: Helps align team members, stakeholders, and clients.
- **Identifies Usability Issues Early**: Detects problems with navigation, hierarchy, and interactions before development.
- **Saves Time and Resources**: Reduces costly rework by addressing issues in the early design phase.
- **Guides Development**: Provides developers with a structured reference to ensure the final product matches the design intent.
